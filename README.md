Hi there 👋. My name is Chacha Ian A.K.A The JavaScript guy. I live in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.

## About

I am very passionate about frontend web development because it is visual. You immediately see what you are building and you can easily showcase your creations to the world. I prefer working with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript when bulding my smaller projects. If I have to build a large project, or a very dynamic website, then I would probably use React.
