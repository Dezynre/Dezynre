Hi there 👋. My name is Chacha Ian A.K.A The JavaScript guy. I live in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.

## About

I am a self taught full stack web developer. With 5years in the industry, I have already gained enough expertise to bootstrap any project. On the frontend, I prefer working with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript when bulding my smaller projects. If I have to build a large project, or a very dynamic website, then I would probably use React. For server side programming logic, Flask is my favorite framework. I am also a Smart Contracts Developer on Ethereum. Please feel free to reach out to me https://twitter.com/citizenofkenya if you have a project that we can work on. I am usually active on twitter.
